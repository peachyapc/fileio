/**
 * This class defines code used to create Runnable 'tasks' to test
 * the file copy mehods in FileUtil.  The subclasses should
 * define their own run() method to perform the actual task.
 * 
 * See the main method for example of how to use this.
 * It uses the Stopwatch and TaskTimer classes from stopwatch project.
 * 
 * All the file copy methods require an input stream (read from file)
 * and an output stream that writes to a file, so this class defines
 * methods to open a file as an InputStream and open an output file 
 * as an OutputStream.  Files can be opened via the constructor or
 * setInput(filename) and setOutput(filename) methods.
 * 
 * The method to open an InputStream shows how to use the ClassLoader
 * to find a file on the classpath of this project.  The classpath
 * includes files in your project's src/ directory.  
 * It is a standard technique for opening resources.
